Today is the china new year.

In the passage way, we must together to view the Spring festival Gala.

Some how the Spring Festival Gala become more and more boring.

But thank god with the development of technology we can choose what we like rather than just to see the Spring festival Gala.

So this year I choose another way to celebrate the new year.

DouyuTV is a network broadcast platform for everyone to be able to live.

We can choose the “individual” we want to look at his life - like twitch.

I want to play the game not much, in addition to stand-alone game on the left StarCraft 2.

On New Year’s Eve, everyone will go home to reunite with their families.But today, I see a lot of “anchor” in their “room” to live, Instead of returning home and a family reunion.

Whether this represents, a trend of people’s entertainment in the Internet age.More and more with subculture as the center of life.

Have a nice day！
